## 🧠 Behind the Name: FinFlo

We started with a simple question:  
**“Can banking feel a little less like spreadsheets… and a little more like Conversation?”**

We knew we wanted something:
- Finance-smart (✅ Fin)  
- Smooth, modern, and flowing (✅ Flo)  
- Easy to say, fun to remember — like a helpful sidekick

After cycling through names like “Capwise” and “BankBot” (😴), we landed on **FinFlo** —  
**Your friendly financial flow coach.**

Quick with a tip. Sharp with a quip.  
**Flo’s not just a name —  
It’s the vibe.**
